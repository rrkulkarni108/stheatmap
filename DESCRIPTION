Description: 
    When we have a large volume of data associated with geographic locations,
    taken over a period of time, it is often difficult to see the relevant patterns
    inherent in the data. In this package we will visualize such data using a 
    function that creates heat maps generated using agglomerative hierarchical 
    clustering with euclidean distance metric on the data. This bigger picture 
    visualization can show us how the variables interrelate with each other on 
    the grand scale and can reveal some interesting associations in specific 
    geographical areas or time points. In this package will also be creating 
    two plotting functions plotENSOSeries() (timeSeriesPlot() is also returned 
    with the other plot) which are specifically for visualizing El Nino Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) Data. I will then also apply this function on a large dataset 
    which involves drought (US Drought Monitor) and wildfires (NASA) in California
    over the time period of 20 years, in addition to ENSO, which can be useful in 
    analysis of how these global and local weather patterns are associated. 
    If time permits I will also implement some plotting functions which show the 
    data on the map of California, which can be extended also to any geographic location.
