Description: 
    When we have a large volume of data associated with geographic locations,
    taken over a period of time, it is often difficult to see the relevant patterns
    inherent in the data. In this package we will visualize such data using a 
    function that creates heat maps generated using agglomerative hierarchical 
    clustering with euclidean distance metric on the data. This bigger picture 
    visualization can show us how the variables interrelate with each other on 
    the grand scale and can reveal some interesting associations in specific 
    geographical areas or time points. In this package contains two functions and three plots, 
    two plotting functions plotENSOSeries() (timeSeriesPlot() is also returned 
    with the other plot) which are specifically for visualizing El Nino Southern
    Oscillation (ENSO) Data; the other function visualizes a large dataset 
    which involves drought (US Drought Monitor) using a heatmap. A comparison of these two
    visualizations drought in addition to ENSO, can be useful in 
    analysis of how these global and local weather patterns are associated. 
    A subset of these two data sources over the time period of 20 years, and 
    in the State of California, is discussed in the vignette.
